## What Is Independent Means?

Australian personal financial modelling and scenario analysis web app, live at **independentmeans.com.au**.  
7-stage wizard → deterministic JS calculation engine → categorised observations and action points.

**Key differentiator:** All projections are rules-based, calculated from the user's actual inputs. No AI features in the running app — this is a deliberate AFSL compliance decision (AI output risks being construed as financial advice).

## 7-Stage Wizard

| Stage | Name | Key inputs |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Household Profile | Name, age, partner, dependants, employment, retirement age, life expectancy, ownership |
| 2 | Income & Cashflow | Gross income, partner income, bonus, monthly expenses, savings/month, budget items |
| 3 | Assets & Savings | Asset items array, emergency fund |
| 4 | Property & Debt | PPOR, mortgage, investment properties[], HECS, credit cards, personal loans |
| 5 | Super & Goals | Super balances, SG rate, salary sacrifice, target retirement spending |
| 6 | Analysis | Scenario comparison, net worth chart, Monte Carlo fan chart, Strategy Centre, warnings |
| 7 | Financial Summary | Categorised observations, action points, adviser topics, PDF/CSV export |

---

## Subscription Tiers

| Tier | Key features |
|---|---|
| **Free** | All 7 stages, base scenario, net worth chart, FIRE number, basic tax, warnings |
| **Trial (14 days)** | All Premium features — starts on first premium gate click, no credit card |
| **Premium** | Monte Carlo, scenario comparison, custom assumptions, Div 293, carry-forward, franking credits, debt recycling, Strategy Centre, PDF export, CSV export |

Pricing: A$15/month or A$149/year. Stripe Checkout + Customer Portal.

---

## Entitlement System

- `src/features.js` — `FEATURES` object with all feature flag string constants
- `src/useEntitlement.js` — `useEntitlement(userId)` hook; returns `{ can(featureId), status, isTrial, trialDaysLeft, openPortal, refreshSubscription }`
- `EntitlementContext` — provided at App root, consumed via `useContext(EntitlementContext)`
- `src/PremiumGate.jsx` — wraps any UI element; shows gate overlay or UpgradeModal for non-entitled users

---

## Legal & Compliance

- AFSL-compliant: general information only, no "you should", no advice language
- No em dashes in user-facing copy
- No "planner" or "plan" in user-facing text
- `src/LegalModals.jsx` — canonical source for Terms and Privacy content; `SiteFooter` component used in both landing page and authenticated app (popup style)
- `#static-links` in `index.html` — invisible HTML links (Pine text on Pine background) satisfying Google OAuth policy; `useEffect` in App.jsx hides them when user is signed in
- `public/privacy.html` and `public/terms.html` — standalone pages remain live

---

## Security Constraints (Non-Negotiable)

- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must **never** have `VITE_` prefix
- Supabase anon key `sb_publishable_*` is publishable (safe for frontend); secret key must never go client-side
- Price IDs resolved server-side only; client sends only `planType: 'monthly'|'annual'`
- JWT verification on all Stripe API endpoints
- `stripe_customer_id` looked up server-side from DB, never trusted from client
- `localStorage` keys `clearpath_v1` and `clearpath_stage` must **not** be renamed (breaks existing user sessions)

---

## Calculation Engine (engine.js)

| Function | What it calculates |
|---|---|
| `projectSuper(data, assumptions)` | Super balance at retirement + SG + salary sacrifice |
| `retirementDrawdown(data, assumptions, superBalance)` | Year-by-year drawdown, depletion age, SWR |
| `debtFreeDate(data)` | PPOR amortisation — debt-free year, monthly payment |
| `netWorthTrajectory(data, assumptions)` | Year-by-year net worth to life expectancy |
| `runEngine(data, options)` | Calls all four; returns `{ trajectory, monteCarlo, metrics, assumptions, householdTax }` |

Options: `{ skipMonteCarlo: bool, skipAdvancedTax: bool }` — Monte Carlo skipped for free users.

Trajectory row shape: `{ age, year, netWorth, superBalance, liquidAssets, propertyValue, totalDebt, isRetired, eventTypes }`.

## Modelling Scenarios

| Scenario | Return | Inflation | Property | Rental | SWR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Base | 6.5% | 2.5% | 4.5% | 3.0% | 4.0% |
| Conservative | 5.5% | 3.0% | 3.5% | 2.5% | 4.0% |
| Aggressive | 7.5% | 2.0% | 5.5% | 3.5% | 4.0% |

## Copy & Compliance Rules

- Never present outputs as personal financial advice

- Always frame projections as modelling assumptions with uncertainty
- Always suggest adviser review (AFSL holder) for tax, super strategy, debt, insurance, investment allocation
- Standard disclaimer: *"General information only. Not personal financial advice."*
- No AI features in the app (AFSL compliance risk)
